### Exercise 3.1
**Consider the GDP information in _global_economy_. Plot the GDP per capita for each country over time. Which country has the highest GDP per capita? How has this changed over time?**.

```{r exercise3.1, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

\ 

### Exercise 3.2
**For each of the following series, make a graph of the data. If transforming seems appropriate, do so and describe the effect**.

**_United States GDP from global_economy_**
```{r exercise3.2US-GDP, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```


**_Slaughter of Victorian “Bulls, bullocks and steers” in aus_livestock_**
```{r exercise3.2AusLivestock, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```


**_Victorian Electricity Demand from vic_elec_**
```{r exercise3.2ElectricityDemand, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```


**_Gas production from aus_production_**
```{r exercise3.2GasProduction, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

\ 

### Exercise 3.3
**Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for the canadian_gas data**?


\ 

### Exercise 3.4
**What Box-Cox transformation would you select for your retail data (from Exercise 8 in Section 2.10)**?


\ 

### Exercise 3.5
**For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation in order to stabilise the variance. Tobacco from aus_production, Economy class passengers between Melbourne and Sydney from ansett, and Pedestrian counts at Southern Cross Station from pedestrian**.


\ 

### Exercise 3.7
**Consider the last five years of the Gas data from aus_production**.
```{r exercise3.7, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gas <- tail(aus_production, 5*4) %>% select(Gas)
```

**3.7 A. _Plot the time series. Can you identify seasonal fluctuations and/or a trend-cycle_**?


**3.7 B. _Use classical_decomposition with type=multiplicative to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices_**.


**3.7 C. _Do the results support the graphical interpretation from part a_**?


**3.7 D. _Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data_**.


**3.7 E. _Change one observation to be an outlier (e.g., add 300 to one observation), and recompute the seasonally adjusted data. What is the effect of the outlier_**.


**3.7 F. _Does it make any difference if the outlier is near the end rather than in the middle of the time series_**?


\ 

### Exercise 3.8
**Recall your retail time series data (from Exercise 8 in Section 2.10). Decompose the series using X-11. Does it reveal any outliers, or unusual features that you had not noticed previously**?


\ 

### Exercise 3.9
**Figures 3.19 and 3.20 show the result of decomposing the number of persons in the civilian labour force in Australia each month from February 1978 to August 1995**.


**3.9 A. _Write about 3–5 sentences describing the results of the decomposition. Pay particular attention to the scales of the graphs in making your interpretation_**.


**3.9 B. _Is the recession of 1991/1992 visible in the estimated components_**?
